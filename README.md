# Course 3 Project

The file "run_analysis.R", when put into a working directory with the Samsung data, will perform the following:

1) Read in the train and test datasets

2) Combine the train and test datasets into a single dataset

3) Read in the file "features.txt" and extract the features related to mean and std calculations

4) Apply a function that renames the features based off of abbreviations found in names of old features

5) Applies the new feature names to be the names of the dataset

6) Takes the mean of the columns of the dataset

7) Writes the new dataset to a file called "table2.txt"
